# xFacility2013
This project is aborted.

These codes is providing for legacy xfacility tools.(from 2012 to early 2013)
It's strongly recommeded not to use for making a new xfacility tools.

Using xFacility2014 - the newest version of xFacility, you can make a tool faster and safer than before.

Any question is not receptible about these codes.
